TODO: 
- Develop abstractions for defining letters with discrete sets of points
- Test discrete algorithms
- Interpolate discrete points to create continuout distribution

In progress:
- displaying multiple letters as sets of discrete points


Current status:
- can display single letters as a set of discrete points


Workflow:
- make a PR to group related changes together
- if changes are small, self-approve and merge
- if changes are significant, wait for approval

TODO: 
- Develop abstractions for defining letters with discrete sets of points
- Test discrete algorithms
- Interpolate discrete points to create continuout distribution

In progress
- animating particles to move from one location to another
- debugging performance issues with threejs particles
- implementing working optimal transport algorithm


Current status:
- dynamically enter text
- display letters in proper, curved shapes
- using threejs for rendering


Workflow:
- make a PR to group related changes together
- if changes are small, self-approve and merge
- if changes are significant, wait for approval

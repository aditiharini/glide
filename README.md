TODO:
Graphics Experiments
- distance based on color (map similar colors close to each other)-Rose
- add force fields- gravity, vortex, sound- Aditi
- formulate as a graph problem --> load object files for complex 3D shape testing- Rose
- include some sort of random indexing for color matching--Rose
- enable uploading OBJ files
- use ExtrudeGeometry to extrude shapes and do 3D mapping- Aditi
- experiment with heuristics for creating a more 1-to-1 mapping

UI Features
- drag camera
- zoom in/out
- make buttons/inputs look nicer
- sound effects

In progress
- debugging performance issues with threejs particles (jk)


Current status:
- dynamically enter text
- display letters in proper, curved shapes
- display transportation of letters



Workflow:
- make a PR to group related changes together
- if changes are small, self-approve and merge
- if changes are significant, wait for approval
